## About Me

I’m an Open Source and Civic Hacker. Nothing is more important to me than working on an interesting project. This often leads to me working on a bunch of projects at the same time. GitHub is my projects safe haven. My desire and curiosity also leads me to try new technologies and explore different MeetUp groups like Code for NoVA where we focus on Civic Hacking as part of Code for America. I am also co-organizer of the group as well! I’m also a morning person and enjoy coffee, so I also try to go to NoVA Code and Coffee. 

Most of my projects usually revolve around using Python, because it’s my favorite language. It’s easy to use and very versatile. I’m also an avid fan of the Django Web Framework, and make lots of use out of it. Where else could you get an amazing bootstrapped Web Framework for Python? Another favorite language I enjoy using is Go, because it’s definitely powerful, quick, and efficient. However I’m no expert in it. Other languages I use that I’m pretty skilled at are Bash, Javascript (though I prefer other libraries and frameworks over barebones), HTML5, and CSS3 (Sass especially). I’ve also flirted with many other languages, but none of them except V(lang) has really tempted me away from my core languages. 

I live by many mottos, but one that would help illustrate me most is:
*Curiosity, never stops at who, what, when, how, or why. There’s always something else to be curious about, and curiosity is always fun.*
