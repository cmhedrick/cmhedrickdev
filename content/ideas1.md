Summary: My first post is all about my ideas!
## Quick Forward
I'll have many of these types of posts where I'll list my ideas that I gathered over time in between posts. These are just some simple ideas I'd like to keep track of. This way if I ever need an idea on a project I could do I could refr back here and begin something new! I will also drop in some mentions of my current projects I'm working on. These mentions may be somewhat vague because it may be a small experiment, or a project that may have other collaborators.

## Project Ideas
### Article Summary Script/App
One of the projects I've been interested in is making a script or web app that can take a link to an article and then produce a summary. I have many interests and want to stay up to date with various news stories. However a method to keep readers engaged (and probably helps with a word quota as well) is by sometimes including croft such as extraneous details, jokes, maybe even lousy gifs. Some times I like reading the entirety of an article but if it's something that I'm reading just to stay informed than all I really need is a summary. I've found a couple of articles that were wel worth the read on how to approach this. Now I just need to follow up!

### Extract Text From Pictures
Another big thing I've been thinking about is an app that would allow me to accurately extract text from various images. There isn't a huge use case for this. But I have found some instances when doing ARG's ([Alternate Reality Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game)) that it would be amazing to have something extract text.

### Image Recognition
In the theme of recognizing images/faces with computers, there was a project a while back that I got interested in. Someone made a really nice easy to set up Virtual Box for demonstrating face recognition using [OpenCV](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html). I'll include the links to them in the resources. But I'd also like to be able to learn some Machine Learning and work with OpenCV to train a program how to recognize objects. This would just be a nice silly thing to get some bragging rights to make along with being nifty again on some ARG's.

## Current Projects
### Twilio Quest
So I recently ran across Twilio Quest one day when looking through my feeds. I was bored and wanted to play a game, so I said "why not?". I was not disappointed. Twilio Quest opened up the flood gates to a new the new world of interacting with SMS and VOIP. Essentially the game focuses around using Twilio to complete various tasks using just about any language (though I've obviously stuck with Python). I've been able to send texts and send calls. It's really intresting and theres plenty of more complex operations I have yet to explore. So this isn't the highest of my priority projects, its more of a palate cleanser.

### Graphene and Django
So I'm working on an interesting project with many moving parts. Well, to be fair, I may be hyping it up a bit. But the core technologies of my current project that I'm in the midsts of drawing up Database diagrams for is going to be using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) along with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) ([in the form of Graphene](https://graphene-python.org/)). Django is my favorite Web Framework in the world, because it has so many built-ins that it makes life really easy. Graphene is coming to play as it will help make essentially the equivalent of a REST API, but with a lot of benefits as built-in. GraphQL is meant to make life with dealing with REST API's alot easier because it provides data filtering, which helps to cut down on response times. Additionally it has a nifty feature known as "Subscriptions", which allow to help manage live updates. To do this you really only need to set up websockets, and with Python that's prett easy.

### Blog and Branding
Not really a to heavy of a technical project, but I am setting up my blog along with my "brand". I'm at a point where I feel I need to really brand myself and my expertise. After all I have 6 years of professional experience and that came with more than just technical experience. After awhile you learn about what types of places you want to work and how you want to work! I'm working in the field and industry of my dreams and need to stop looking at work as "just as a paycheck". So to help better my chances of getting into places I want to work I'm creating a "brand" for myself. 
To do this I'm using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) for generating my site. Pelican has been pretty intuitive so far(?). I still find some oddities here and there but nothing to big. I was able to make some edits to the Attila theme so that way I can use Particles.js to make cool visualizations as headers. So fun stuff :D
